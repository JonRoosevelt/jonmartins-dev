## Welcome

Hello folks. 
It's a pleasure for me to welcome all of you to my personal page.
It's been a while since I've been planning to create my personal page. I mean, I am a developer, but as they say *The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot*.
I'll do my best to keep this blog updated. I actually already have a blog on Medium, but since they changed their business model and started to charge so your blog can be open to all, I think I lost interest.

Anyways, though I'm a technologist, you can expect lots of different subjects here. From tech stuff to spirituality, from life hacks to illustrations, from music recommendations to memes. Yeah, I plan to turn this intoa reflection of my troubled mind.

I hope you like it.

With ❤️

Jon
