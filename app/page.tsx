        <p>Hello, my name is Jon Martins üëãüèΩ</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I&apos;m a fullstack developer from Brazil, working specifically with
          NodeJS, Python, React, Typescript and .NET
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Though I am mostly focused in these technologies, I truly believe that
          developers should see tech as tools. If you&apos;re lost on a beach
          and you need to write a message to a plane, you won&apos;t use the
          most modern pen to do it. You won&apos;t use an iPad to do it.
          You&apos;ll use sticks, stones and palm leaves! üèù
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To ensure a nice final product, I really like to write tests. For me
          TDD is one of the best ways to make sure you won&apos;t have that many
          bugs in production - though, you will ü§£

          History
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I was born in Brazil, a son of the 80&apos;s. I started drawing as a
          little kid, got my first gig as an illustrator at 13. At 16 I switched
          to design and started a technical course in SENAI, which is a famous
          design school in Brazil. I worked from 16 to 26 as a designer, from
          printing companies to agencies and as a freelancer as well (which I
          occasionally still do).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On 2014, after the Football (yeah, it&apos;s called football and not
          soccer) World Cup, a huge crisis hit Brazil and I lost my job as a
          designer. I was already studying computer programming before so it was
          the last drop of water to make a career change.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During this period I&apos;ve enrolled in a System Analysis and Design
          minor and started to do some freelancing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On 2019 I got my first actual job a a programmer. Ever since I have
          worked in several different companies with lots of contexts. I&apos;ve
          learned a lot, from back to front end, from testing to scrum, from
          feature branch to trunck based development, from working in flip flops
          to leaving to home at past midnight. I was able to work in lots of
          technologies and multiple background people, which have contributed to
          who I am right now.

          As I said in my introduction, I&apos;m a technology agnostic. But that
          doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t have my preferences. Here&apos;s a few
          of them:
